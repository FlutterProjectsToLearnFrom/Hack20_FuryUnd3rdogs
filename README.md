# 🏮&nbsp; Arcade Mania 

A flutter and flame based android game and creating an arcade retro glimpse with Atari console feels.

## ✍&nbsp; About the project

Games that contain memories built with flutter and flame with the original Atari console look.

<br>

“Retro is a symptom of a generation that is too lazy to innovate.” keeping this in mind, we used Flutter and Flame to build this game project for Hack20. We tried to bring atari 90s feels to the flutter based mobile game and memorize everyone with it.
